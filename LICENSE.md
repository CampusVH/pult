PULT is Free Software (Open Source) under the
[ GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html),
either version 3 of the licence, or, at your option, any later version.

In short this means:

 * You are free to run the software, for any purpose.

 * You are free to study how the software works and to adopt it
   to your needs.
   
   To make this possible, you have, as a user of the software,
   the right to obtain its source code, *even if the software
   runs on a server, and you only connect to that server*.
   (This “even on a server” clause is what distinguishes the
   GNU Affero GPL from the “normal” GNU GNU GPL.)

 * You are free to redistribute copies of this software,
   gratis or for a fee, *provided that you don't deny
   anyone the rights we gave to you*.
   (This “provided that” clause is the *Copyleft*
   principle, an essential feature of the GNU licences.)
   
 * You are free to improve this software and to redistribute
   your improvements, so everyone can benefit from them.

   Again, you may do this as a charity service, but you are also
   free to found a business providing this kind of service.

 * There is NO WARRANTY, unless you are paying someone
   to provide a warranty for you.

The GNU AGPL applies to PULT itself.  Many components used by PULT
are under different licences.  However they are all Free Software,
and their licence conditions are essentially subsets of those of
the GNU AGPL.
